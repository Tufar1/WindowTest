WindowTestOld.cpp contains some of my researches from Microsoft documentation and used links. Absolutely basic window creation with 2 squares.
WindowTest.cpp contains little bit more advanced technique using Direct2D.
This is my first try and I do not guarantee good Implementation of anything. This is made for me as some type of roadmap and code review for others
